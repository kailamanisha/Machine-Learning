**Income Prediction using Machine Learning**

Performed exploratory data analysis on a large dataset of 34,000 instances and successfully handled all missing values • Implemented data preprocessing, and data mining methods to convert imbalanced dataset to balanced dataset • Executed model fitting across three models, logistic regression, neural networks, and support vector machine. The neural network model was concluded to be the most accurate model with an accuracy of 83%
